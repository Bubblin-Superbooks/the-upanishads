word?  All that language can express must be finite, since it is itself
finite.  Yet it is very difficult for mortals to think or speak of anything
without calling it by a definite name.  Knowing this, the Sages gave to the
Supreme the name A-U-M which stands as the root of all language.  The first
letter "A" is the mother-sound, being the natural sound uttered by every
creature when the throat is opened, and no sound can be made without opening
the throat.  The last letter "M," spoken by closing the lips, terminates all
articulation.  As one carries the sound from the throat to the lips, it passes
through the sound "U."  These three sounds therefore cover the whole field of
