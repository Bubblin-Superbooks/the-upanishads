knowledge that comes from the senses and all that comes from
Spirit.</p><p>The special purpose of this Upanishad is to give us the knowledge
of the Real, that we may not come under the dominion of the ego
by identifying ourselves with our body, mind and senses.  Mortals
become mortals because they fall under the sway of ego and depend
on their own limited physical and mental strength.  The lesson of
the parable of the Devas and Brahman is that there is no real
power, no real doer except God.  He is the eye of the eye, the
ear of the ear; and eyes, ears, and all our faculties have no
power independent of Him.  When we thus realize Him as the
underlying Reality of our being, we transcend death and become
immortal.</p><p>OM! PEACE! PEACE! PEACE!</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
