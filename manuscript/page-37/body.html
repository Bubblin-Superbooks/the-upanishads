<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Here the sun, who is the giver of all light, is used as the symbol of the
Infinite, giver of all wisdom.  The seeker after Truth prays to the Effulgent
One to control His dazzling rays, that his eyes, no longer blinded by them,
may behold the Truth.  Having perceived It, he proclaims: "Now I see that that
Effulgent Being and I are one and the same, and my delusion is destroyed." By
the light of Truth he is able to discriminate between the real and the unreal,
and the knowledge thus gained convinces him that he is one with the Supreme;
that there is no difference between himself and the Supreme Truth; or as
Christ said, "I and my Father are one."</p><p>XVII</p><p>May my life-breath go to the all-pervading and immortal Prana,
and let this body be burned to ashes.  Om!  O mind, remember thy
deeds!  O mind, remember, remember thy deeds!  Remember!</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Seek not fleeting results as the reward of thy actions,</p></div> </div>
