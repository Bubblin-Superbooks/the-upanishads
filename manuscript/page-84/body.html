exercises power; this determinative faculty is governed by the individual
Self; beyond this Self is the undifferentiated creative energy known as
Avyaktam; and above this is the Purusha or Supreme Self.  Than this there is
nothing higher.  That is the goal, the Highest Abode of Peace and Bliss.</p><p>XII</p><p>This Atman (Self), hidden in all beings, does not shine forth;
but It is seen by subtle seers through keen and subtle
understanding.</p><p>If It dwells in all living beings, why do we not see It? Because the ordinary
man's vision is too dull and distracted.  It is visible to those alone whose
intellect has been purified by constant thought on the Supreme, and whose
sight therefore has become refined and sharpened.  This keenness of vision
comes only when all our forces have been made one-pointed through steadfast
practice of concentration and meditation.</p></div> </div>
