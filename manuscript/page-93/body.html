foetus is well-guarded in the womb by the mother, (that fire) is
to be worshipped day after day by wakeful seekers (after wisdom),
as well as by sacrificers. This verily is That.</p><p>Fire is called all-seeing because its light makes everything
visible.  In Vedic sacrifices the altar fire was always kindled
by rubbing together two sticks of a special kind of wood called
Arani.  Because fire was regarded as one of the most perfect
symbols of Divine wisdom, it was to be worshipped by all seekers
after Truth, whether they followed the path of meditation or the
path of rituals.</p><p>IX</p></div> </div>
