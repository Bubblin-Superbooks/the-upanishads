<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">cannot be heard or felt or smelled or tasted like
any ordinary object.  It never dies.  It has no beginning or end.  It is
unchangeable.  Realizing this Supreme Reality, man escapes from death and
attains everlasting life.  Thus the Teacher has gradually led Nachiketas to a
point where he can reveal to him the secret of death.  The boy had thought
that there was a place where he could stay and become immortal.  But Yama
shows him that immortality is a state of consciousness and is not gained so
long as man clings to name and form, or to perishable objects.  What dies?
Form.  Therefore the formful man dies; but not that which dwells within.
Although inconceivably subtle, the Sages have always made an effort through
similies and analogies to give some idea of this inner Self or the God within.
They have described It as beyond mind and speech; too subtle for ordinary
perception, but not beyond the range of purified vision.</p></div> </div>
