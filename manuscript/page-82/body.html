control and always pure, he reaches that goal, from which he is
not born again.</p><p>IX</p><p>The man who has a discriminative intellect for the driver, and a
controlled mind for the reins, reaches the end of the journey,
the highest place of Vishnu (the All-pervading and Unchangeable
One).</p><p>A driver must possess first a thorough knowledge of the road; next he must
understand how to handle the reins and control his horses.  Then will he drive
safely to his destination.  Similarly in this journey of life, our mind and
senses must be wholly under the control of our higher discriminative faculty;
for only when all our forces work in unison can we hope to reach the goalâ€”the
abode of Absolute Truth.</p></div> </div>
