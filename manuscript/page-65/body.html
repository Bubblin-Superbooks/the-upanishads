known only when taught by another (a wise teacher).  O
Nachiketas, thou hast attained It.  Thou art fixed in Truth.  May
we ever, find a questioner like thee.</p><p>Knowledge of the Atman or Self cannot be attained when it is taught by those
who themselves lack in real understanding of It; and who therefore, having no
definite conviction of their own, differ among themselves as to its nature and
existence.  Only he who has been able to perceive the Self directly, through
the unfoldment of his higher nature, can proclaim what It actually is; and his
words alone carry weight and bring illumination.  It is too subtle to be
reached by argument.  This secret regarding the Hereafter cannot be known
through reasoning or mere intellectual gymnastics.  It is to be attained only
in a state of consciousness which transcends the boundary line of reason.</p><p>X</p></div> </div>
