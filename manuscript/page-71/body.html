anything, nor did anything spring from It.  This Ancient One is
unborn, eternal, everlasting.  It is not slain even though the
body is slain.</p><p>XIX</p><p>If the slayer thinks that he slays, or if the slain thinks that
he is slain, both of these know not.  For It neither slays nor is
It slain.</p><p>XX</p><p>The Self is subtler than the subtle, greater than the great; It
dwells in the heart of each living being.  He who is free from
desire and free from grief, with mind and senses tranquil,
beholds the glory of the Atman.</p></div> </div>
