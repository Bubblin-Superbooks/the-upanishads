for the Imperishable.  This Mantram or text is often chanted at the hour of
death to remind one of the perishable nature of the body and the eternal
nature of the Soul.  When the clear vision of the distinction between the
mortal body and the immortal Soul dawns in the heart, then all craving for
physical pleasure or material possession drops away; and one can say, let the
body be burned to ashes that the Soul may attain its freedom; for death is
nothing more than the casting-off of a worn-out garment.</p><p>XVIII</p><p>O Agni (Bright Being)!  Lead us to blessedness by the good path.
O Lord!  Thou knowest all our deeds, remove all evil and delusion
from us.  To Thee we offer our prostrations and supplications
again and again.</p><p>Here ends this Upanishad</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
