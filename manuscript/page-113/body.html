penetrates the centre of the head. Going upward through it, one
attains immortality.  The other (hundred nerve-courses) lead, in
departing, to different worlds.</p><p>The nervous system of the body provides the channels through
which the mind travels; the direction in which it moves is
determined by its desires and tendencies.  When the mind becomes
pure and desireless, it takes the upward course and at the time
of departing passes out through the imperceptible opening at the
crown of the head; but as long as it remains full of desires, its
course is downward towards the realms where those desires can be
satisfied.</p><p>XVII</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The Purusha, the inner Self, of the size of a thumb,</p></div> </div>
