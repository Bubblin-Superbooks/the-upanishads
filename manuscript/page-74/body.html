<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>XXIII</p><p>This Self cannot be attained by study of the Scriptures, nor by
intellectual perception, nor by frequent hearing (of It); He whom
the Self chooses, by him alone is It attained.  To him the Self
reveals Its true nature.</p><p>We may imagine that by much study we can find out God; but merely hearing
about a thing and gaining an intellectual comprehension of it does not mean
attaining true knowledge of it.  Knowledge only comes through direct
perception, and direct perception of God is possible for those alone who are
pure in heart and spiritually awakened.  Although He is alike to all beings
and His mercy is on all, yet the impure and worldy-minded do not get the
blessing, because they do not know how to open their hearts to it.  He who
longs for God, him the Lord chooses; because to him alone can He reveal His
true nature.</p></div> </div>
