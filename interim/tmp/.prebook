The gentleman, then\nbattling with a fatal malady, took from his library shelf a\ntranslation of the Upanishads and, opening it, expressed deep\nregret that the obscure and unfamiliar form shut from him what he\nfelt to be profound and vital teaching."

The translation and commentary then given\nwere transcribed and, after studious revision, were published in\nthe Centre's monthly magazine, \"The Message of the East,\" in 1913\nand 1914.. Still further revision has brought it to its present\nform."

While retaining in remarkable measure the rhythm and\narchaic force of the lines, he has tried not to sacrifice\ndirectness and simplicity of style. Where he has been obliged to\nuse the Sanskrit term for lack of an exact English equivalent, he\nhas invariably interpreted it by a familiar English word in\nbrackets; and everything has been done to remove the sense of\nstrangeness in order that the Occidental reader may not feel\nhimself an alien in the new regions of thought opened to him."

To treat it as an object of mere intellectual curiosity\nis to cheat the world of its deeper message. If mankind is to\nderive the highest benefit from a study of it, its appeal must be\nprimarily to the spiritual consciousness; and one of the salient\nmerits of the present translation lies in this, that the\ntranslator approaches his task not only with the grave concern of\nthe careful scholar, but also with the profound reverence and\nfervor of the true devotee."

    "innerHtml": "The Upanishads represent the loftiest heights of ancient\nIndo-Aryan thought and culture. They form the wisdom portion or\nGnana-Kanda of the Vedas, as contrasted with the Karma-Kanda or\nsacrificial portion. In each of the four great Vedas—known as\nRik, Yajur, Sama and Atharva—there is a large portion which\ndeals predominantly with rituals and ceremonials, and which has\nfor its aim to show man how by the path of right action he may\nprepare himself for higher attainment. Following this in each\nVeda is another portion called the Upanishad, which deals wholly\nwith the essentials of philosophic discrimination and ultimate\nspiritual vision. For this reason the Upanishads are known as the\nVedanta, that is, the end or final goal of wisdom (Veda, wisdom;\nanta, end)."
  },
  {
    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "The name Upanishad has been variously interpreted. Many claim\nthat it is a compound Sanskrit word Upa-ni-shad, signifying\n\"sitting at the feet or in the presence of a teacher\"; while\naccording to other authorities it means \"to shatter\" or \"to\ndestroy\" the fetters of ignorance. Whatever may have been the\ntechnical reason for selecting this name, it was chosen\nundoubtedly to give a picture of aspiring seekers \"approaching\"\nsome wise Seer in the seclusion of an Himalayan forest, in order\nto learn of him the profoundest truths regarding the cosmic\nuniverse and God. Because these teachings were usually given in\nthe stillness of some distant retreat, where the noises of the\nworld could not disturb the tranquillity of the contemplative\nlife, they are known also as Aranyakas, Forest Books. Another\nreason for this name may be found in the fact that they were\nintended especially for the Vanaprasthas (those who, having\nfulfilled all their duties in the world, had retired to the\nforest to devote themselves to spiritual study)."
  },
  {
    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "The form which the teaching naturally assumed was that of\ndialogue, a form later adopted by Plato and other Greek\nphilosophers. As nothing was written and all instruction was\ntransmitted orally, the Upanishads are called Srutis, \"what is\nheard.\" The term was also used in the sense of revealed, the\nUpanishads being regarded as direct revelations of God; while the\nSmritis, minor Scriptures \"recorded through memory,\" were\ntraditional works of purely human origin. It is a significant\nfact that nowhere in the Upanishads is mention made of any author\nor recorder."
  },
  {
    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "No date for the origin of the Upanishads can be fixed, because\nthe written text does not limit their antiquity. The word Sruti\nmakes that clear to us. The teaching probably existed ages before\nit was set down in any written form. The text itself bears\nevidence of this, because not infrequently in a dialogue between\nteacher and disciple the teacher quotes from earlier Scriptures\nnow  to us. As Professor Max M�ller states in his lectures\non the Vedanta Philosophy: \"One feels certain that behind all\nthese lightning-flashes of religious and philosophic thought\nthere is a distant past, a dark background of which we shall\nnever know the beginning.\" Some scholars place the Vedic period\nas far back as 4000 or 5000 B.C.; others from 2000 to 1400 B.C.\nBut even the most conservative admit that it antedates, by\nseveral centuries at least, the Buddhistic period which begins in\nthe sixth century B.C."

    "innerHtml": "The value of the Upanishads, however, does not rest upon their\nantiquity, but upon the vital message they contain for all times\nand all peoples. There is nothing peculiarly racial or local in\nthem. The ennobling lessons of these Scriptures are as practical\nfor the modern world as they were for the Indo-Aryans of the\nearliest Vedic age. Their teachings are summed up in two\nMaha-Vakyam or \"great sayings\":—Tat twam asi (That thou art) and\nAham Brahmasmi (I am Brahman). This oneness of Soul and God lies\nat the very root of all Vedic thought, and it is this dominant\nideal of the unity of all life and the oneness of Truth which\nmakes the study of the Upanishads especially beneficial at the\npresent moment."

It was here that\nfor the first time the original thinkers of the Upanishads, to\ntheir immortal honor, found it....\""

    "innerHtml": "The first introduction of the Upanishads to the Western world was\nthrough a translation into Persian made in the seventeenth\ncentury. More than a century later the distinguished French\nscholar, Anquetil Duperron, brought a copy of the manuscript from\nPersia to France and translated it into French and Latin.\nPublishing only the Latin text. Despite the distortions which\nmust have resulted from transmission through two alien languages,\nthe light of the thought still shone with such brightness that it\ndrew from Schopenhauer the fervent words: \"How entirely does the\nOupnekhat (Upanishad) breathe throughout the holy spirit of the\nVedas! How is every one, who by a diligent study of its Persian\nLatin has become familiar with that incomparable book, stirred by\nthat spirit to the very depth of his Soul! From every sentence\ndeep, original and sublime thoughts arise, and the whole is\npervaded by a high and holy and earnest spirit.\" Again he says:\n\"The access to (the Vedas) by means of the Upanishads is in my\neyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818)\nmay claim before all previous centuries.\" This testimony is borne\nout by the thoughtful American scholar, Thoreau, who writes:\n\"What extracts from the Vedas I have read fall on me like the\nlight of a higher and purer luminary which describes a loftier\ncourse through a purer stratum  free from particulars, simple,\nuniversal.\""

Since that time there have been\nvarious European translations—French, German, Italian and\nEnglish. But a mere translation, however accurate and\nsympathetic, is not sufficient to make the Upanishads accessible\nto the Occidental mind. Professor Max M�ller after a lifetime of\narduous labor in this field frankly confesses: \"Modern words are\nround, ancient words are square, and we may as well hope to solve\nthe quadrature of the circle, as to express adequately the\nancient thought of the Vedas in modern English.\""

    "innerHtml": "Without a commentary it is practically impossible to understand\neither the spirit or the meaning of the Upanishads. They were\nnever designed as popular Scriptures. They grew up essentially as\ntext books of God-knowledge and Self-knowledge, and like all text\nbooks they need interpretation. Being transmitted orally from\nteacher to disciple, the style was necessarily extremely\ncondensed and in the form of aphorisms. The language also was\noften metaphorical and obscure. Yet if one has the perseverance\nto penetrate beneath these mere surface difficulties, one is\nrepaid a hundredfold; for these ancient Sacred Books contain the\nmost precious gems of spiritual thought."

    "innerHtml": "Every Upanishad begins with a Peace Chant (Shanti-patha) to\ncreate the proper atmosphere of purity and serenity. To study\nabout God the whole nature must be prepared, so unitedly and with\nloving hearts teacher and disciples prayed to the Supreme Being\nfor His grace and protection. It is not possible to comprehend\nthe subtle problems of life unless the thought is tranquil and\nthe energy concentrated. Until our mind is withdrawn from the\nvaried distractions and agitations of worldly affairs, we cannot\nenter into the spirit of higher religious study. No study is of\navail so long as our inner being is not attuned. We must hold a\npeaceful attitude towards all living things; and if it is\nlacking, we must strive fervently to cultivate it through\nsuggestion by chanting or repeating some holy text. The same\nlesson is taught by Jesus the Christ when He says: \"If thou bring\nthy gift to the altar and there rememberest that thy brother hath\naught against thee; leave there thy gift before the altar and go\nthy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and\noffer thy gift.\""

If we are not fully conscious of that\nwhich sustains our life, how can we live wisely and perform our\nduties? Whatever we see, movable or immovable, good or bad, it is\nall \"That.\" We must not divide our conception of the universe;\nfor in dividing it, we have only fragmentary knowledge and we\nthus limit ourselves."

Knowing this, he becomes free\nfrom the bondage of matter and transcends death.  Transcending\ndeath means realizing the difference between body and Soul and\nidentifying oneself with the Soul.

So long\nas the drop remains separate from the ocean, it is small and\nweak; but when it is one with the ocean, then it has all the\nstrength of the ocean.
