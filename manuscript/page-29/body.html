<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">heaven and
hell is only temporary; because our actions, being finite, can produce only a
finite result.</p><p>What does it mean "to kill the Self?" How can the immortal Soul ever be
destroyed? It cannot be destroyed, it can only be obscured.  Those who hold
themselves under the sway of ignorance, who serve the flesh and neglect the
Atman or the real Self, are not able to perceive the effulgent and
indestructible nature of their Soul; hence they fall into the realm where the
Soul light does not shine.  Here the Upanishad shows that the only hell is
absence of knowledge.  As long as man is overpowered by the darkness of
ignorance, he is the slave of Nature and must accept whatever comes as the
fruit of his thoughts and deeds.  When he strays into the path of unreality,
the Sages declare that he destroys himself; because he who clings to the
perishable body and regards it as his true Self must experience death many
times.</p></div> </div>
